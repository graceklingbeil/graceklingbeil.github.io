    Hello, I am 21 years old and I am from the Chicago land area. I guess you could say the suburbs outside Chicago. I do not have any previous web application or development training which makes this class a bit scary for me. I am new to all of it so it may take me a little more to understand. My expectations include absorbing all information that I can. I want to learn all about websites, and hopefully it is something I can take away for the future. With my learned development skills I may want to work in media in the future. I feel working with websites will be cool, but I haven't quite figured that out yet. So with the skills I will learn it can maybe help with future jobs or with my parents if they ever need a website. In my free time I like to do photography. I am very fascinated by taking photographs. I also enjoy creating film and editing, hence why my major is digital storytelling. I also love being around my friends and spending quality time with them.
